# Sample Rails Application

The sample application developed throughout the book [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl] (http://michaelhartle.com/).

The application is a microblogging knock-off of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/). Manually built without Rails scaffolding, for the sake of learning the ropes of the Rails environment.

More *anon*.
